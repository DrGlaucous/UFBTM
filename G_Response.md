When deciding between using a singular linear regulator to supply 3.3V to everything versus routing 5V to each device and letting them regulate down to 3.3V individually, the key factor to consider is **efficiency** and how power is being dissipated.

### Option 1: Singular 3.3V Linear Regulator

In this option, you'd use a single 3.3V linear regulator to supply power to all your devices. Here's the efficiency breakdown:

* **Power dissipation in the regulator**: A linear regulator essentially works by dropping the voltage difference (in this case, from 5V to 3.3V) as heat. The power dissipated in the regulator is $P_{dissipated} = (V_{in} - V_{out}) \times I_{load}$. So, if you have many devices, you need to consider the total current draw of all the devices combined.

  For example, if the total current drawn by all devices is 1A, the power dissipated as heat will be:

  $$
  P_{dissipated} = (5V - 3.3V) \times 1A = 1.7W
  $$

  In this scenario, the regulator would have to burn off that excess energy as heat, which is wasteful.

* **Efficiency**: The efficiency of a linear regulator is $\frac{V_{out}}{V_{in}}$. For 5V to 3.3V, the efficiency is:

  $$
  \text{Efficiency} = \frac{3.3V}{5V} = 66\%
  $$

  This means that 33% of the input power is wasted as heat.

### Option 2: Route 5V to Devices, Let Them Use Their Own Linear Regulators

In this option, you supply 5V directly to each device, and they regulate it down to 3.3V individually. Here's the analysis:

* **Power dissipation**: Each device's linear regulator will still dissipate power, but only for the current drawn by that particular device. The power dissipation per device is calculated the same way as in the first option:

  $$
  P_{dissipated\_device} = (5V - 3.3V) \times I_{device}
  $$

  If each device draws 100mA, the power dissipated per device would be:

  $$
  P_{dissipated\_device} = (5V - 3.3V) \times 0.1A = 0.17W
  $$

* **Efficiency**: The efficiency of each individual regulator is still $\frac{3.3V}{5V} = 66\%$, so the overall efficiency per device remains the same as in Option 1. However, each device's regulator will only need to handle the current for that particular device.

### Key Differences and Considerations

* **Heat Dissipation**: If you route 5V to each device, each device will dissipate less power since only its own current draw is involved in the dissipation, whereas in the first scenario, the single regulator will dissipate heat for all devices combined.

* **Overall Power Loss**: The total power loss in both cases should theoretically be similar, but Option 1 could result in more heat because you're running everything through a single regulator. This could require more cooling or thermal management. In Option 2, the heat is spread out among each individual deviceâ€™s regulator.

* **Simplicity**: Option 1 is simpler to implement because you only need one regulator. However, managing the heat dissipation becomes a challenge as the number of devices increases. Option 2, while a bit more complex, distributes the load and may be more scalable.

### Conclusion

From a pure **power efficiency** standpoint, both options are essentially the same in terms of the efficiency of individual linear regulators (around 66%). However, **Option 2** (routing 5V to each device) is generally the better choice because:

1. It distributes the heat dissipation across multiple devices rather than relying on one central regulator.
2. If you have many devices, the total thermal load from a single regulator can be significant, whereas in Option 2, each device only needs to deal with its own power dissipation.

If you can tolerate a slightly more complex design, Option 2 is likely to be the better solution for both efficiency and scalability.
