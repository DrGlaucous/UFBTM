BMI160 chip shcematic:

See:
https://www.bosch-sensortec.com/media/boschsensortec/downloads/datasheets/bst-bmi160-ds000.pdf
SCX is the clock for SPI/I2C

SDX is:
MOSI for SPI4
SISO for SPI3
SDA for I2C


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
pin to breakout transaltions for BMI160:
[chip pin]: [breakout pin]
SDO: SAO (main i2c address, pulled up)
ASDX: SDX (magnetometer i2c, no resistor)
ASCX: SCX (magnetometer i2c, no resistor)
INT1: INT1
VDDIO: Regulated Vin (from LDO) - VIN
GNDIO: GND
GND: GND
VDD: Regulated Vin (from LDO) - VIN
INT2: INT2
OSCB: OCS (for OCS interface, not really used)
OSDO: Not Connected
CSB: CS (chip select for main SPI, pulled up)
SCX: SCL (main i2c, pulled up)
SDX: SDA (main i2c, pulled up)

x4 capacitors between positive and ground
x4 392 resistors, 2 for i2c, and 2 for CS and SAO
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The GY-271/3 is much more basic;
5-pin interface:
[breakout pin]
VCC (regulated, 3-5V)
GND
SCL (pulled up, in 271, this is boosted to vin levels)
SDA (Pulled up, in 271, this is boosted to vin levels)
DRDY (direct from chip)

good battery type:
804040
or 804050
[8mm][40mm][50mm]
[80]4050

The charger modules:
LX-LBES - brand name

simmilar variants:
LN-MLIC
LX-LBC3

the aliexpress couterpart is commonly called the the "TP4057"

good site that provides some info on the components on this module:
https://www.adrirobot.it/caricabatteria-litio-li-ion-step-up-boost-4-28v-regolabile/

switch footprint:
SS12D10 //flat, not as good, can be bumped and turned off
or
SS12D06 //90 deg


some useful info on charging the module:
https://forum.arduino.cc/t/charging-lithium-ion-battery-using-the-usb-port-on-esp32-c3-supermini-with-tp4056-and-powering-the-esp32-with-the-battery-when-not-connected-via-usb/1302012/3


intended behavior:

plugging in device will power it up and charge it, regardless of switch state

battery will only discharge when switch is ON.
battery should be able to be charged regardless of switch state.


using a single connector (data + battery) will mean 


alternatives to the c3 supermini:
ESP32-C3-Zero Pro Mini (bigger PCB antenna, potentially easier to swap to the external one... but that may not be needed, as seen by some tests by others)

https://peterneufeld.wordpress.com/2025/03/04/esp32-c3-supermini-antenna-modification/

Other names for this board:
New Micro ESP32-C3
ESP32-C3_Mini_V1

May need:
uFL antenna 2.4g


If I have gobs of time, (I don't), this would also be interesting to look into for bad wi-fi connections

https://www.reddit.com/r/esp32/comments/18y9fq0/esp32_connecting_to_a_wifi_network_and_espnow_at/
We could also use esp-now and serial to send packets directly to the handler device without having to go through a home wifi network first


potential connector types:
https://www.mattmillman.com/info/crimpconnectors/common-jst-connector-types/

JST 2.5mm (probably the cheapest and most universal, XH)
or JST 2mm - (ph connector)
or JST ZH ()
jst PH20

or JST 1.25mm
Mini Micro JST-1.25mm


or 5264 connector

or headphone jack (2.5mm)!
PJ-210B
PJ-320A
(these may have a shorting problem... I need to either look into the safest way of routing connections or use a different connector.
A disappointment because otheriwse, they're perfect for my needs)


A USB conector that's obscure so people don't try to plug in a generic connector to it
Mini USB 8P
